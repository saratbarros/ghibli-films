# Ghibli Films

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). <br>
Status: Ongoing project - trying to master React and finding ways to create cleaner code.

## The Task
→ Build a small React app calling in data via an API https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films <br>
→ Styling/Layout on the screenshots must be followed and it must be fully responsive. On mobile, the content can stack with the image above the content. Hint: pseudo
classes are used for layering the images.<br>
→ Hover styles on buttons are optional, but might be good to show something interesting.<br>
→ Please add a back button on the single movie pages, so you can return to the overview page.<br>
→ We will need this hosted on GitHub Pages or something similar for us to view.<br>
